# AAW Developer Docs

The main purpose of this documentation site is to provide developer-facing documentation for large-scale platform features that are implemented across many repositories. Additionally, this site also contains information about useful developer tooling and other onboarding information that developers may wish to refer back to.

Information about individual repoositories can be found in the `README.md` and associated documentation for those repositories.
